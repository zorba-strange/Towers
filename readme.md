The approach taken-
	Shot high, miss far, start over. 
	After an attempt to create a more interative game. I found myself out
	of depth and scrapted everything and started new.
	Second approach was to get my MVP.
	Once I had that, I went back in and try to implement other things.
	This latter approach was much better.

Installation instructions-
	clone, open in index.html in chrome(no idea if it works in others) and
	play.

unsolved problems-
	Wanted to make it more drag and drop interactive.
	Wanter to turn the background into a rick roll video upon winning.
	Wanted to clone a brick and show that clone on potential move
	locations. (was cloest one this aspect)

etc-
	ect.
